# python_automation_cpp
This is how to run cpp program and organize all of your executable files inside of one folder /bin, since in unix system you can't add them to  .gitignore 
Now, I will not add bin to .gitignore for purpose of this example, but you can add it! 

If you want to run this, you should install terminal command keys extensions on you vscode, then you should configure a shortcout in keybindings.json as I show you in this repository (keybindings_config.js). Just have to do it once. 

With all that you are able to press cmd+b and cmd+h and your cpp code will run and
your exe files will be added to /bin folder.
